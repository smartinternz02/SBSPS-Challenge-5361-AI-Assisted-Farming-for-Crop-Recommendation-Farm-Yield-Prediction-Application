## Introduction
This is a Software model on AI-assisted farming for crop recommendation and yield prediction using machine learning solutions.

## Proposed Solution
Making an application that recommends farmers about the best crops to be cultivated based on climatic and nutrient parameters and also predicts the yield and revenue that would be generated for the cultivated land. 

The proposed solution is implemented by making use of IBM services (Watson studio / Auto ai/ build machine learning model) and by creating an interactive GUI-based web Interface. 

- A  Machine Learning model that predicts the amount of yield produced and also recommends crops using IBM capabilities.
- Recommends crops using IBM capabilities 
- Integrate the model with UI(User interface) 
- Presenting data in an interactive web application. 


## Software Designing
A solution model has been created using Django Web Application Framework and Watson Studio. The web App with a Machine learning model can provide the Solution prediction accurately.

IBM Watson Desktop, IBM Cloud, IBM Auto AI, IBM Watson Studio, Android, python Django web development framework, sqlite3, sklearn.


## Applications
- Used in food industries.
- Used in warehouse management.
- Machine learning techniques allow accurate results of prediction.
- Compared to traditional demand forecasting methods, machine learning accelerates data processing speed.


## Conclusion
Therefore, our project can be used to predict the yield produced and the crop recommended. 

## Future Scope
The scope of this project is to determine the crop yield of an area by making use of datasets with features that are considered to be vital for the production and sustenance of crops such as temperature, moisture, rainfall, nutrients present in the soil, and also based on the production of the crops in previous years. The yield can be precisely calculated with the help of various regression models available in Watson studio, Watson Assistant, and various other IBM services.

The growing demand for Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in almost every industry is compelling employees across the globe to learn new skills in Data Science. It is said that AI and ML are expected to impact and transform our lives in ways beyond imagination similar to the internet.

Fortunately for demand planners, ML can now help further improve the forecast from 40% of actual to 70% of actual. 
Machine Learning can predict future weather patterns at the local level and identify how it connects to local demand patterns. Machine Learning can also determine if a lag exists between the weather changes and the demand of products on a real-time basis. The life cycle of a product plays a critical role in demand
